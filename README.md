## Usage

Import this in Logisim-evolution: `Project -> Load Library -> Logisim-evolution Library`.

You should see a CD4029 folder appear in your toolbar and you can use the packaged model as a component in your design.

This aims to be an accurate model of the CD4029, implemented as depicted in the [CD4029 Types datasheet from TI](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd4029b.pdf?ts=1614549274196). While this has been accurate in my usage and test cases (student projects in Digital Logic Design), that has been at relatively low-speed operation and so I would appreciate any feedback on how this model does at higher speeds and in general.
